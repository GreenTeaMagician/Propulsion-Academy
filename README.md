# Propulsion-Academy Daily Work

During a three month bootcamp into fullstack-development, we have performed an immense amount of original work in the form of simple exercises. As the course went on, the exercises became more difficult, and finally cumulated in a final project, the link for which is here.

## Overview

### Backend

**Week 1** - During this week, we were given a thorough introduction to Python, where we solved simple exercises for the first few days (including OOP). The week concluded with PyGame, where we developed a Snake, and a [Bricks](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week1/Day5/Bricks) game.

**Week 2** - After a thorough python jumpstart, we turned our attention to storing information on databases in mySQL and looked at virtual servers, as well as flake8, flask, jinja, and how to use git, PyCharm sand Docker. The final project was a Todo app using all of these elements.

**Week 3** - For Week 3, we dived into Django, in conjunction with Docker and deployment. We created models and allowed for authentication to our API using tokens. The final project was a functioning social media API, with posts, likes and friendrequests which we completed in Week 4.

**Week 4** - Once we had a grip on Django, we moved on to Django REST Framework, where we went into views and serializers, and pulled everything that we have learned this far together into a social media API (without front-end mechanics).

### Frontend

**Week 5** - Here we left Python behind and got introduced to Javascript and functional Programming. Although the structure of the week was very similar to Week 1, it was more fast-paced, because we had a little more experience coding. One of the projects we have completed on day 2, was a Pong game.

**Week 6** - Week 6 was defined by a lightning introduction to jQuery, React, Redux, where we spent a lot of time working on state changes, reducers and trying to understand the whole mechanics of the tool. We created a "dance floor" in jQuery, our own front end social media page (we borrowed from our own, or a sample API). It was also a crash course into HTML and CSS.

**Week 7** - Although we have studied worked through a lot of practical skills, we hadn't gotten any theoretical/mathematical background. Week 7 was designed around giving us a better understanding of how we can use data science, algorithms and other things in order to assist us in becoming more rounded software engineers.
