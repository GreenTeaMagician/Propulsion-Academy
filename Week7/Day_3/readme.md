# JS Advanced - Day 3

Today is all about algorithms and their complexity.  Algorithms are a fundamental concept of Computer Science, and you will be able to apply these concepts to any programming language - not only JavaScript.

But what are is an algorithm? Here's the definition on Wikipedia:

> An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problem [...] within a finite amount of space and time.

There is two components in this definition:
1. The algorithm as *recipe* to solve similar problem.
1. The algorithm taking a certain amount of memory and time to complete.

We will look at both components in detail in today's lessons, and then show you a couple of the most important algorithms in computer science.
