# Propulsion-Academy Daily Work

During a three month bootcamp into fullstack-development, we have performed an immense amount of work in the form of simple exercises. MAny of these exercises were left unfinished, unpolished and as the course went on, the exercises became more difficult, and finally cumulated in a final project in which we had to work on on our own. The link for which is here.

## Overview

### Backend

**Week 1** - During this week, we were given a thorough introduction to Python, where we solved simple exercises for the first few days (including OOP). The week concluded with PyGame, where we developed a Snake, and a [Bricks](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week1/Day5/Bricks/final) game.

**Week 2** - After a thorough python jumpstart, we turned our attention to storing information on databases in mySQL and looked at virtual servers, as well as flake8, flask, jinja, and how to use git, PyCharm sand Docker. The final project was a [Todo](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week2/Day5/rest-flask-api-master) app using all of these elements.

**Week 3** - For Week 3, we dived into Django, in conjunction with Docker and deployment. We created models and allowed for authentication to our API using tokens. The final project was a functioning social media API, with posts, likes and friendrequests which we completed in Week 4.

**Week 4** - Once we had a grip on Django, we moved on to Django REST Framework, where we went into views and serializers, and pulled everything that we have learned this far together into a social media [API](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week4/Django_Restframework) (without front-end mechanics).

### Frontend

**Week 5** - At this point, we left Python behind and got introduced to Javascript and functional Programming. Although the structure of the week was very similar to Week 1, it was more fast-paced, because we had a little more experience coding. One of the projects we have completed on day 2, was a [Pong](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week5/Day2/Pong) game.

**Week 6** - Week 6 was defined by a lightning introduction to jQuery, React, Redux, where we spent a lot of time working with Javascript in the browser, mechanics mixing these components inside the browser. We created a ["dance floor"](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/tree/master/Week6/Day1) in jQuery, and build an online market using react and Redux. The project was also a crash course into HTML and CSS.

**Week 7** - We continued our in work in React/Redux. We did another exercise creating a [Trivia game](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/Week7/Trivia), while the final three days of the week we worked our [own front end social media page](https://github.com/GreenTeaMagician/Propulsion-Academy/Week7/Blitz) (we borrowed from our previous, or a sample API).

**Week 8** - Although we have studied worked through a lot of practical skills, we hadn't gotten any theoretical/mathematical background to computer science. Week 7 was designed around giving us a better understanding of how we can use data science, algorithms and other things in order to assist us in becoming more rounded software engineers.

### Professional Project

**Week 9** - In this week, we were asked to complete a yelp/social media app on our desktops in groups of three. I worked with two other teammates to create such an app from scratch, using virtually everything that we have learned in this course. The project will be available via link right here.

### Personal project: Filigree

**Week 10 - 13** - The final project asked us to make our own idea of an app into reality. During this time, there were no lessons, people had the chance to come and go as they please and people worked independently from each other (with the exception of those people who decided to work together). We had intructors available if we had specific questions, but the idea was to do this project on your own, with the things we've learned throughout the course. The project has been placed in a separate repository, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/MichalBurgunder/Filigree).
